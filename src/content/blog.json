    "content": "Deploying AI features requires a fundamentally different approach to testing and validation. Traditional unit tests aren't enough when dealing with probabilistic outputs and emergent behaviors. In this post, I'll explore how to build comprehensive evaluation systems that measure AI performance across multiple dimensions - accuracy, safety, latency, and user experience. We'll cover techniques like adversarial testing, benchmark suites, human-in-the-loop validation, and continuous monitoring that enable teams to ship AI features with confidence while maintaining quality standards...",

    "content": "The development landscape is rapidly evolving with two major trends: low-code/no-code platforms promising to democratize software creation, and AI coding tools that augment developer productivity. But which approach delivers better results? In this analysis, I'll compare platforms like Bubble, Webflow, and OutSystems against AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude. We'll examine factors like development speed, code quality, maintainability, scalability, and total cost of ownership. The answer isn't black and white - each approach has distinct advantages depending on your project requirements, team expertise, and long-term goals...",

    "content": "As AI becomes central to business operations, organizations face a critical decision: deploy models on-premise or rely on cloud-based LLM services? This choice impacts everything from data privacy and compliance to cost structure and performance. In this deep dive, I'll analyze the trade-offs between running models like Llama, Mistral, or custom fine-tuned models on your own infrastructure versus using OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google's APIs. We'll cover security considerations, latency requirements, cost modeling, scalability challenges, and maintenance overhead. I'll also share real-world case studies and provide a decision framework to help you choose the right approach for your specific use case...",
